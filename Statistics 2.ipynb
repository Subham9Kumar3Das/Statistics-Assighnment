    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability within a dataset. They provide information about how the data points are distributed around the central tendency (mean, median, or mode). Here's a brief explanation of each measure and an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range:\n",
    "\n",
    "The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "Range = Maximum Value - Minimum Value\n",
    "It provides a basic understanding of how much the data values vary.\n",
    "Example: Consider the following dataset of exam scores: [60, 70, 75, 80, 90]. The range is 90 (maximum) - 60 (minimum) = 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance measures the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n",
    "A higher variance indicates greater variability in the dataset.\n",
    "Variance = Σ(x - μ)² / (N - 1), where Σ represents the sum, x is each data point, μ is the mean, and N is the number of data points.\n",
    "Example: Let's say we have a dataset of ages: [25, 30, 35, 40, 45]. The mean is 35. The variance is calculated as:\n",
    "Variance = [(25-35)² + (30-35)² + (35-35)² + (40-35)² + (45-35)²] / (5-1) = 125 / 4 = 31.25\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a more interpretable measure of how much the data values deviate from the mean.\n",
    "A higher standard deviation indicates greater dispersion.\n",
    "Standard Deviation = √Variance\n",
    "Example: Using the same dataset of ages, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, which is √31.25 ≈ 5.59.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range provides a quick and simple way to understand the spread of data, but it doesn't consider all data points and can be sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance considers all data points, but the values are squared, which might not be in the same unit as the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation is a more interpretable measure, as it is in the same unit as the original data, and it takes into account all data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures help us understand how tightly or widely data points are distributed in a dataset and are essential for various statistical analyses and decision-making processes."
